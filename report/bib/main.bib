of time flow. Arrowized FRP (AFRP) is a version of FRP embedded in Haskell based on
the arrow combinators. AFRP is a powerful synchronous dataflow programming language
with hybrid modeling capabilities, combining advanced synchronous dataflow features
with the higher-order lazy functional abstractions of Haskell. In this paper, we describe
the AFRP programming style and our Haskell-based implementation. Of particular interest
are the AFRP combinators that support dynamic collections and continuation-based switching.
We show how these combinators can be used to express systems with an evolving structure
that are difficult to model in more traditional dataflow languages.},

abstract = {Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing
abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless
computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, which are programs
that respond to external events. When demand for the serverless function spikes, the
platform automatically allocates additional hardware and manages load-balancing; when
demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform
detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web
Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions
are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless
computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard
for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this
problem by presenting λλ, an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing.
Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λλ models all the low-level details
that serverless functions can observe. To show that λλ is useful, we present three
applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics
of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λλ
coincide. Second, we augment λλ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful
serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless
function composition, we show how to extend λλ with a composition language and show
that our implementation can outperform prior work.},

abstract = {Swift is a new, principled approach to building web applications that are secure by
construction. In modern web applications, some application functionality is usually
implemented as client-side code written in JavaScript. Moving code and data to the
client can create security vulnerabilities, but currently there are no good methods
for deciding when it is secure to do so. Swift automatically partitions application
code while providing assurance that the resulting placement is secure and efficient.
Application code is written as Java-like code annotated with information flow policies
that specify the confidentiality and integrity of web application information. The
compiler uses these policies to automatically partition the program into JavaScript
code running in the browser, and Java code running on the server. To improve interactive
performance, code and data are placed on the client side. However, security-critical
code and data are always placed on the server. Code and data can also be replicated
across the client and server, to obtain both security and performance. A max-flow
algorithm is used to place code and data in a way that minimizes client-server communication.},
